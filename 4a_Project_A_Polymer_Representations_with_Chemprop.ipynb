        "\n",
        "In the workshop notebooks, we have used pairs of monomers in the form `A.B` to represent polymers with many bonded, repeating units i.e. `A-B-A-B-A-B-....` or -`[A-B-]n`. The benefit of this approach is its simplicity: it is easy to create polymer representations that contain the correct atoms and therefore contain all of the important groups of atoms that define chemical properties.\n",
        "The downside of this approach is that the two monomers do not interact with each other properly, as the monomers do not share any bonds. They therefore cannot pass messages to each other, limiting the function of Chemprop for generating hidden representations. This is a polymer-specific problem.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this project, you will be predicting electron affinities of the same polymer photocatalysts as in the workshop. Your goal is to train Chemprop models using different lengths of given SMILES strings (\"oligomer length\") to represent the polymers:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   pairs of monomers (format A.B)\n",

        "*   octamers (A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B)\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, you will need a new dataset (\"dataset_oligomers.csv\"), which is provided in the GitHub repository. Evaluate the performances of these models against each other and draw conclusions on how SMILES input type affects architecture, hyperparameters, training and performance of your model. You might want to utilise some of the resources given below.\n",

        "3.   Describe the training process and show training loss curves. How does the oligomer length affect training?\n",
        "4.   Discuss the impact of your hyperparameter optimisations. Explain why your reasoning for hyperparameter selection and tuning. Present your best hyperparameters.\n",
        "5.   Present key performance metrics from your best model. How do these change as a function of oligomer length?\n",
        "6.   What is limiting the model and how it could be further improved?\n",

        "* Explore how changing the oligomer length affects the performance of the fixed representations model. Compare this to your Chemprop models.\n",
        "* Evaluate the performance of these models as a function of dataset size.\n",
        "* Create multi-task models, in which EA and IP are predicted simultaneously. Does model performance improve? Why/why not?\n",
